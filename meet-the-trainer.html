      <h2>Carolyn Neville: Managing Director</h2>
      <p> I have a BA degree with majors in English and Anthropology, as well as a certificate in Coaching from the UCT Centre for Coaching.  Having grown up in a family of hoteliers, and lived in a city centre hotel for the first seventeen years of my life, I am steeped in the industry – it runs through my veins!

I have thirty-five years experience in training, having worked for the Industrial Society UK (a management training organisation) in London, as well as running the Price Waterhouse Training Centre in London.  For the past twenty –five years, I have been running my own training company, both in Harare, Zimbabwe and in Cape Town, South Africa. 

I have been involved in both training and consulting with a range of clients, from backpackers to five star hotels.  I have worked extensively throughout Africa in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, Nigeria and Ghana.

I have ties with CATHSETTA and have my NQ Assessor Licence as well as an Advanced Trainers Qualification from THETA.  I was a Board Member for FEDHASA Cape in 2010.  I am currently the Chairperson of the Observatory Civic Association.
